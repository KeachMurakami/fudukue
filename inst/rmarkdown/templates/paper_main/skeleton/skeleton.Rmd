## Plant materials

## Model

First order reaction is expressed as follows

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{dy}{dt} = -k_d y,
`r set_label()`
\end{equation}
`r update_ref(id = "first_order", list_name = "eqn")`

where *k*~d~ is a rate coefficient for the decay. 
(`r ref_eqn("first_order", eqn_prefix[1])`).

## Statistical analysis



# Results

Mention your data simply and carefully.

## Some result

```{r, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:sample}This is a caption for a scatter plot."}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(mpg, cyl, col = factor(am))) +
  geom_point()
```

`r update_ref("sample", list_name = "fig")`

\newpage

There was a negative correlation between `mpg` and `cyl` (`r ref_fig("sample", fig_prefix[1])`).



# Discussion

The most important section.

## high mpg decrease cyl?

Blur blur. Hoge hoge.
